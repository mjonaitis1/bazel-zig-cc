go_binary overrides go_binary from rules_go and provides default
gc_linkopts values that are needed to compile for macos target.
To use it, add this map_kind gazelle directive to your BUILD.bazel files
where target binary needs to be compiled with zig toolchain.

Example: if this toolchain is registered as bazel-zig-cc in your WORKSPACE, add this to
your root BUILD file
# gazelle:map_kind go_binary go_binary @bazel-zig-cc//rules:go_binary_override.bzl
